# Pantheon
Roguelike focused on emergent and dynamic gameplay by way of highly component-based design. Built in Unity.

Pantheon was the second game I tried to make. In summer of 2019 I took a brief interest in roguelikes and the technology behind them, and worked on Pantheon in the 5 months following. The idea at the beginning was to, rather than following the world's deities (a trope of roguelikes), instead attempt to forcibly unseat them and take their place. This initial flavour eventually evolved into wanting to create a highly mutable world using a flexible system of entity-components.

I stopped working on the project right before 2020 because I realized that roguelikes are not a genre I am interested in playing, so I'm not in a good position to "eat the dog food". If I work on a project like this again, itt will likely be an actual god-game, and implemented either in Unity's ECS or C++ EnTT. For now, feel free to look around.
