# Pantheon
Roguelike focused on emergent and dynamic gameplay by way of highly component-based design. Built in Unity.

Pantheon is a dead project. I worked on it for about 5 months continuously before losing interest and will almost certainly not be touching it again, and if I do, I won't be developing it in Unity. Feel free to look around.
